### Welcome to the Seta Workshop Empty API

First of all, thanks a lot for taking the time to do this, we really appreciate it! ðŸ™‚

For your first PR we will ask you to do the following:

- Configure your local database (it doesn't matter which system you use)

- Create the necessary structures (tables, models, etc) to support **projects**, with their name, when they started and ended, **technologies** in which are being developed, and **users** who work on them (the user attributes is up to you decide what you want them to have).

- Create a controller to allow the creation and update of a project, allowing to add/change their technologies and users.

- Please add endpoints to mentioned controller to list all projects and to get one in particular with all its information (technologies and users). The endpoint that lists all projects must allow to filter them by a particular technology and/or user. For example: we would like to do things like "return all projects that were built using Ruby on Rails", or "return all projects where John Doe worked", or both of them combined.

- Push the code and create a pull request on this repo

**NOTE 1: Bear in mind that there is no right or wrong way to do this (if the concepts are in place and there is a proper justification)**

**NOTE 2: This API responds in JSON format, so the controller actions should return a JSON**

**MOST OF THE DECISIONS ARE UP TO YOU, EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD, IMPROVE, OR CHANGE IS ALLOWED, JUST SHOW OFF WHAT YOU KNOW!**
